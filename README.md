## VAEmodel
Contains the VAE model and the script that runs the training.

## Plots
Contains tools to plot input and output variables, latent variables, the correlation matrix and ROC curves (which gives a measure of the efficiency of te anomaly detection).

## BSM analysis
Contains tools to perform the anomaly detection.
